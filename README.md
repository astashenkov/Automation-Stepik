# Automation QA (Stepik course)

https://stepik.org/course/575/

This is a repository where I publish my solutions to problems from the Stepik automation QA course.
In this course, I'm master Selenium and take the first steps in the automation testing.

After I completed the course, I got the certificate (https://stepik.org/cert/1974083). So, you can congratulate me)
